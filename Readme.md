# URL Shortener

The URL Shortener is a web application built with Node.js that allows you to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.

It utilises MongoDB as the database to store the shortened URLs.:blush::blush::blush:

:star: You can find the Docker version in my [url-shortener](https://github.com/PatriciaHuang99/URL_shortener) repository.
